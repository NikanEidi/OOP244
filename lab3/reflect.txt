In this week i learned about Encapsulation, member function and If i want to describe encapsulation  to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, usually a class. This concept restricts direct access to some of the object’s components, which is essential to prevent accidental modification or misuse of data. Imagine a radio with knobs to adjust the frequency and volume; while you can use these knobs to control the radio, you don’t need to open it and manually adjust internal components. Encapsulation ensures that users interact with the system through well-defined interfaces (public functions), keeping the inner workings secure and less prone to errors.
